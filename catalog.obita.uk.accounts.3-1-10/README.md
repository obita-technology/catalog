# UK Account and Transaction API - v3.1.10

## Introduction

The Account and Transaction API - v3.1.10 is a standardized approach to the integration of account and transaction data, designed for use by Account Information Service Providers (AISPs). This profile specifies the flows and functionality required to enable the registration of an intent to retrieve account information, as well as the subsequent retrieval of account and transaction data. This allows for secure and authorized access to customer data with their consent, providing peace of mind for customers and security for financial institutions.

The profile also outlines the data permissions, expiration, and historical period allowed for transactions and statements that the customer, also known as the PSU (Payment Service User), has consented to provide to the AISP. This information is then stored in the form of an "account access consent," which ensures that the data is accessed only by authorized parties and within the agreed-upon time frame.

In addition to the Account and Transaction API Profile, the Read/Write Data API Profile is also necessary for the full integration of account and transaction data. This profile provides a detailed description of the elements that are common across all the Read/Write Data APIs, ensuring that the integration of account and transaction data is as seamless and standardized as possible. Overall, the Account and Transaction API Profile provides a valuable framework for the integration of account and transaction data, enhancing the security and efficiency of financial data sharing.
